# Object-Detection

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks: TrainedModel.ipynb and WebCam_App.ipynb, which together build and deploy a real-time object classification system. The system uses a trained model to classify objects in real-time using a webcam.

## Project Overview

#### •	TrainedModel.ipynb:
This notebook involves image processing, model building, and training. The dataset is processed to create a model, which is then trained using various machine learning techniques. The trained model is saved locally for further use.
#### •	WebCam_App.ipynb:
This notebook utilizes the previously trained model for real-time object classification through a webcam feed. The trained model is loaded, and real-time classification is performed on the video stream.
